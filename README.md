## RESTful API Inventory App for Fasteners

Currently, a basic outline of a RESTful API to keep an inventory of parts.

It is a CRUD app that uses the Sequelize ORM. Ultimately, it will be a basic inventory management application for fasteners, that
is the *long-term* goal.<br>

Slowly, I will build the frontend using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no plans to use a frontend framework...too much to learn already. ðŸ™ƒ
